Create a small web application using Node.js with ExpressJS and plain JavaScript that does the following:

Reads a configurable local folder containing multiple PDF and EPUB ebooks.

On each page load (or browser refresh), selects:

a random ebook from the folder, and

a random page from that ebook.

Renders that selected page directly in the browser.

Additional requirements:

The app should automatically detect whether a file is PDF or EPUB and handle each format appropriately.

No manual user selection: the book and page must be chosen randomly on every refresh.

There should be a label displaying the filename of the book and the number of the page.

The server should expose a single route (e.g. /) that performs the random selection and serves the content.

Include clear instructions for installing dependencies and running the app locally.

Prefer lightweight, well-maintained libraries for PDF and EPUB rendering.

The final result should be a minimal but functional ExpressJS app that runs locally and works by simply refreshing the browser.
